# Double-Dealer
A 2D isometric game (Inspired Invisible Inc) that my group did for GPS 1 (Game Studio Project 1). I was involved as gameplay, AI and tool programmers.


The Double Dealer is trying to become infamous and recorded in the annals of history. They are attempting to do this by mimicking the ways of Lupin and Robin Hood: robbing and stealing from rich and powerful people. Their story starts from their first heist together which was the Great Museum Heist.
